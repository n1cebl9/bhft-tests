**Autotests for BHFT**

TODO manager tests (TodoAppTests)
1. Integration CRUD and websocket checking. Each todo goes through CRUD operations. Autotest retrieves websocket message after POST and checks it.
2. GET parameters. Offset and limit with different values.
3. POST simple performance. Autotest checks timing for POST requests in a loop.
